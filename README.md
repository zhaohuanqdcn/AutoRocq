This repository contains the source code of AutoRocq, an agent prover in Rocq (formerly Coq) 8.18.0.

To discharge a formally stated theorem in Rocq, the agent runs in the following loop:

```python
context = get_initial_context()
tools = ['plan', 'tactic', 'context_search']
while not coq.is_proof_complete():
    action = llm.next_action(goal, context)
    coq.apply(action)
    context.update()
    goal.update()
```

where the LLM interacts with the Rocq proof assistant (via [CoqPyt](https://github.com/sr-lab/coqpyt)) in real time to develop a proof.

```

### Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies in Python

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

2. Install dependencies in opam

```bash
opam switch import deps.opam
```

### Minimal Example of Proof Agent

1. Set up API key in the config or by running `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`

2. To prove [`examples/example.v`](proof-search/examples/example.v) with a minimal [config](proof-search/configs/minimal.json), go to `proof-search` directory and run:

```bash
python3 -m main examples/example.v --config ./configs/minimal.json
```

If AutoRocq runs successfully, you will be able to see in the terminal
```
[INFO] [Main]: 🎉 Proof completed successfully!
```
and the proof script is saved in the same [`example.v`](proof-search/examples/example.v) file. You will also be able to find saved proof states and aggregated results at `data/`, which can be reused to prove other goals in the future.

For more configurations of the tool, check out the [readme](proof-search/configs/readme.md) or run with `--help` for more options.

### Proving Theorems from Verification Tasks

[AutoRocq-bench](https://github.com/NUS-Program-Verification/AutoRocq-bench) is a corpus of Rocq/Coq proof obligations extracted from real C code with [Frama-C](https://www.frama-c.com/) curated as part of the evaluation of AutoRocq. 
The benchmark consists of 641 theorems generated from [SV-COMP](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/sv-comp/bench-defs) and 60 theorems from [assertions in the Linux kernel](https://github.com/evdenis/verker).
On average, running each theorem costs ~$0.5 with GPT-4.1. 
To test on this benchmark:

1. Clone the submodule with

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Compile `libautorocq` by running

```bash
cd AutoRocq-bench/libautorocq; make
```

3. Configure `library_paths` in `proof-search/configs/default_config.json` to point to `libautorocq`.

4. Run the agent by pointing to the target `.v` file. The first run may take a few minutes to initialize the library.

For example, go to `proof-search` directory and run:

```bash
python3 -m main examples/main_assert_rte_signed_overflow.v --config ./configs/default_config.json
```
