This repository contains the source code of AutoRocq, an agent prover in Rocq (formerly Coq) 8.18.0.

To discharge a formally stated theorem in Rocq, the agent runs in the following loop:

```python
context = get_initial_context()
tools = ['plan', 'tactic', 'context_search']
while not coq.is_proof_complete():
    action = llm.next_action(goal, context)
    coq.apply(action)
    context.update()
    goal.update()
```

where the LLM interacts with the Rocq proof assistant (via [CoqPyt](https://github.com/sr-lab/coqpyt)) in real time to develop a proof.

```

### Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies in Python

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

1. Install dependencies in opam

```bash
opam switch import deps.opam
```

### Minimal Example of Proof Agent

1. Set up API key in the config or by running `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
2. To prove `[examples/example.v](proof-search/examples/example.v)` with a minimal [config](proof-search/configs/minimal.json), go to `proof-search` directory and run:

```bash
python3 -m main examples/example.v --config ./configs/minimal.json
```

If AutoRocq runs successfully, you will be able to see in the terminal

```
[INFO] [Main]: 🎉 Proof completed successfully!
```

and the proof script is saved in the same `[example.v](proof-search/examples/example.v)` file. You will also be able to find saved proof states and aggregated results at `data/`, which can be reused to prove other goals in the future.

For more configurations of the tool, check out the [readme](proof-search/configs/readme.md) or run with `--help` for more options.

### Proving Theorems from Verification Tasks

[AutoRocq-bench](https://github.com/NUS-Program-Verification/AutoRocq-bench) is a corpus of Rocq/Coq proof obligations extracted from real C code with [Frama-C](https://www.frama-c.com/) curated as part of the evaluation of AutoRocq. 
The benchmark consists of 641 theorems generated from [SV-COMP](https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/sv-comp/bench-defs) and 60 theorems from [assertions in the Linux kernel](https://github.com/evdenis/verker).
On average, running each theorem costs ~$0.5 with GPT-4.1. 
To test on this benchmark:

1. Clone the submodule with

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

1. Compile `libautorocq` by running

```bash
cd AutoRocq-bench/libautorocq; make
```

1. Configure `library_paths` in `proof-search/configs/default_config.json` to point to `libautorocq`.
2. Run the agent by pointing to the target `.v` file. The first run may take a few minutes to initialize the library.

For example, go to `proof-search` directory and run:

```bash
python3 -m main examples/main_assert_rte_signed_overflow.v --config ./configs/default_config.json
```

### Interactive Mode

In addition to running AutoRocq in a hands-off style, you can *co-develop* Rocq proofs with the agent in interactive mode.
The agent exposes a REPL where you can steer, inspect, and contribute tactics alongside the LLM.

**Starting interactive mode** — pass `--interactive` (or `-i`) on the command line:

```bash
python3 -m main examples/example.v --config ./configs/minimal.json --interactive
```

Or enable it permanently in your config:

```json
{
  "interactive": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

**What interactive mode does**

- **Stepping through proofs** — you can step through AutoRocq's generation and understand its trajectory.
- **Adding hints for agent** — You can add natural language `hint` to guide AutoRocq's proof strategy.
- **Co-writing proofs** — you can directly add `tactic`, print `tree`, run `search`, or `rollback` as you wish. Existing proof steps and manual edits are preserved, AutoRocq picks up exactly where you left.

**REPL commands**

| Command        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `step`         | Agent takes one action (tactic attempt or rollback), then pauses                                                                                                                                |
| `run`          | Agent runs until the focused goal changes, the agent rolls back, or the proof completes. Failed tactics are handled internally and do not stop `run`                                            |
| `tactic <tac>` | Apply a Rocq tactic directly (bypasses the LLM). Example: `tactic intros n.`                                                                                                                    |
| `hint <text>`  | Inject a natural-language hint into the agent's next prompt. Example: `hint try induction on n`                                                                                                 |
| `rollback [n]` | Undo the last `n` applied tactics (default 1), regardless of whether they were applied by you or the agent. If `n` exceeds the number of applied tactics, rolls back to `Proof.` with a warning |
| `search <cmd>` | Run a Rocq query and print the results (display-only; does not inject into LLM context). Examples: `search Search Z.add`, `search Print Z.add_comm`, `search Check Z.add`                       |
| `status`       | Display the current proof goal and hypotheses                                                                                                                                                   |
| `explain`      | Show agent reasoning history                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `tree`         | Display the current proof tree with tactic history                                                                                                                                              |
| `help`         | Print all available commands                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `quit`         | Exit the session                                                                                                                                                                                |
